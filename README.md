# bookmark-notes
A super simple and easy way to save notes as bookmarks :blush:

Everything is saved in the url itself. Update the message, change the color background if you want and copy the url. Your url contains all the information. Just share it with anyone or save it whereever you like.

When you start typing, it automatically updates the URL and title. Simple, easy and fun!

### Where can this be useful

* Saving notes to Browser Bookmarks, and organize it like pro with folders
* Third party bookmarking services where you want to save some notes which do not support note clipping along with bookmarking

The good example would be using **pinteret save button**,  **chrome bookmarks**, **raindrop.io** etc.

### Where it all started

I tried to save some clippings to the pinterest and it doesn't support anything but the photos and url. So, let's save it in the URL :wink:

### How to?
Open or bookmark this link: https://kirtan403.github.io/bookmark-notes/index.html

Open and add some text, copy the URL and you are good to go. 

> Fear I will remove or change this URL? **I won't, I promise!** Still don't trust me? You can clone this repo and enable github pages from settings and URL will be all yours!

### Troubleshooting

Just quick note. If any service is fetching meta data like title from the html title tag, then it may not return actual text. As the text is processed using javascript when the page loads. But, if it supports having an extension or bookmarklet, which grabs the title from the currentlt loaded page, it will work great!
